## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES & CONCERNS (The Bad)

### 1. **Constants Inconsistency** üî¥ **PRIORITY: HIGH**

**Problem:** Constants defined in two places with different values

**Location 1:** `src/utils/constants.ts`
```typescript
TRACKER_PENALTY: -1,
CLEAN_SITE_REWARD: 2,
NON_COMPLIANT_PENALTY: -5,
```

**Location 2:** `src/background/privacy-score.ts`
```typescript
private static readonly TRACKER_PENALTY = -1;
private static readonly CLEAN_SITE_REWARD = 2;
private static readonly NON_COMPLIANT_PENALTY = -5;
```

**Issue:** Duplication leads to maintenance burden and potential bugs if one is updated but not the other.

**Fix:** Import from constants file or remove unused constants.ts values.

### 2. **Unused Constants File** üü° **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**

**Problem:** `src/utils/constants.ts` exists but is never imported anywhere in the codebase.

**Impact:** Dead code that adds confusion. Developers might think these constants are being used.

**Fix:** Either use it consistently throughout or remove it.

### 3. **Storage Performance Issue** üü° **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**

**Location:** `src/background/storage.ts`

**Problem:** Debounced saves with 500ms delay
```typescript
private static readonly SAVE_DELAY = 500; // ms
```

**Issue:** 
- If service worker suspends before flush, data loss possible
- Multiple rapid updates queue up but only last state is saved
- `ensureSaved()` called on suspend, but race condition possible

**Current mitigation:** `chrome.runtime.onSuspend` listener exists, which is good.

**Improvement needed:** Consider immediate save for critical operations (score updates, settings changes).

### 4. **Event Emitter Memory Management** üü° **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**

**Location:** `src/background/event-emitter.ts`

**Problem:** Event log grows unbounded until 100 entries
```typescript
private eventLog: Array<{ type: EventType; timestamp: number }> = [];
private maxEventLog = 100;
```

**Issue:** In memory without cleanup, though 100 is reasonable.

**Missing:** No way to clear event log or handlers programmatically for testing.

**Fix:** Add cleanup method for event log; clear() already exists for handlers.

### 5. **Tab Manager Memory Leak Risk** üü° **PRIORITY: MEDIUM**

**Location:** `src/utils/tab-manager.ts`

**Problem:** Cleanup runs every hour, but stale tabs accumulate
```typescript
cleanup(): void {
  const cutoff = Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
  // Only removes inactive tabs older than 24 hours
}
```

**Issue:** 
- User with 100+ tabs and no cleanup could accumulate memory
- Cleanup only runs on periodic interval, not on actual tab close

**Fix:** Clean immediately on `onRemoved` event, not just periodically.

### 6. **Firewall Engine Badge Timer Leak** üî¥ **PRIORITY: HIGH**

**Location:** `src/background/firewall-engine.ts`

**Problem:** Badge update timers stored in Map but only cleared on cleanup
```typescript
private static badgeUpdateTimers = new Map<number, NodeJS.Timeout>();

cleanup(): void {
  for (const timer of this.badgeUpdateTimers.values()) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  }
  this.badgeUpdateTimers.clear();
}
```

**Issue:** 
- Cleanup runs every hour via `setupCleanupInterval()`
- If user closes tabs, timers may persist until cleanup
- Timers should be cleared when tab is removed

**Fix:** Clear timer for specific tab when tab is closed.

### 7. **Logger Race Condition** üü° **PRIORITY: LOW**

**Location:** `src/utils/logger.ts`

**Problem:** Auto-initialization is async but logs write immediately
```typescript
private writeLog(entry: LogEntry): void {
  // Ensure initialization happens asynchronously (non-blocking)
  this.ensureInitialized().catch(() => {
    // Silent fail - logger will work with in-memory buffer
  });
  
  this.logBuffer.push(entry); // Writes immediately
  this.scheduleFlush(); // Schedules save
}
```

**Issue:** If storage fails to initialize, logs work but never persist.

**Current behavior:** Acceptable - logs to console always, storage is "best effort".

**Improvement:** Add status indicator or warning if storage fails.

### 8. **Message Bus Timeout Handling** üü° **PRIORITY: LOW**

**Location:** `src/utils/message-bus.ts`

**Problem:** 5-second timeout for all messages
```typescript
async send<T = unknown>(type: MessageType, data?: unknown, timeout = 5000): Promise<T>
```

**Issue:**
- Some operations might need longer (e.g., loading large tracker lists)
- No retry mechanism
- Rejected promises may be unhandled in calling code

**Fix:** Make timeout configurable per message type or add retry logic.

### 9. **Popup Loading State** üü° **PRIORITY: LOW**

**Location:** `src/popup/popup.tsx`

**Problem:** Retry interval continues even after data loads
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  if (!data) {
    loadData();
  }
}, 2000);

return () => {
  clearInterval(interval);
};
```

**Issue:** Interval only checks `!data` but dependency array includes `data`, causing effect to re-run and create new interval.

**Fix:** More precise cleanup logic or use separate useEffect.

### 10. **Alert Storage Limit** üü¢ **PRIORITY: LOW**

**Location:** `src/background/storage.ts`

**Problem:** Hard limit of 100 alerts
```typescript
if (data.alerts.length > 100) {
  data.alerts = data.alerts.slice(0, 100);
}
```

**Issue:** Older alerts silently dropped without user knowledge.

**Current behavior:** Acceptable for most users.

**Improvement:** Add UI to show "Showing 100 of X alerts" or export before clearing.

   ```typescript
   // Current (bad):
   if (acceptArea > rejectArea * 1.5) {
   
   // Better:
   const BUTTON_PROMINENCE_THRESHOLD = 1.5;
   if (acceptArea > rejectArea * BUTTON_PROMINENCE_THRESHOLD) {
   ```

### B. **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Batch Event Emissions**
   - When multiple trackers blocked in quick succession
   - Batch score updates to reduce storage writes

1. **Add Error Recovery**
   ```typescript
   // Current: Silent failure
   catch (error) {
     logger.error('...', error);
     return fallback;
   }
   
   // Better: Recovery attempts
   catch (error) {
     logger.error('...', error);
     await this.attemptRecovery();
     return fallback;
   }
   ```

2. **User-Facing Error Messages**
   - Show notification when critical errors occur

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Handles a blocked tracker request and updates state
    * @param url - The URL of the blocked request
    * @param tabId - The ID of the tab where the request was blocked
    * @returns Promise that resolves when handling is complete
    */
   static async handleBlockedRequest(url: string, tabId: number): Promise<void>
   ```

2. **Add Contributing Guide**
   - How to add new trackers
   - How to test changes
   - Code style guide

3. **Add API Documentation**
   - Document all public methods
