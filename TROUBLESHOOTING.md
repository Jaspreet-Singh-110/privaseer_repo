# Troubleshooting Guide

## Error: "Failed to fetch" in Content Scanner

### Problem
You see this error in the console:
```
Failed to initialize consent scanner: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

### Root Cause
Content scripts run in a sandboxed environment and cannot directly access extension resources without explicit permission.

### Solution ‚úÖ
The manifest now includes `web_accessible_resources` which makes data files accessible to content scripts:

```json
"web_accessible_resources": [
  {
    "resources": [
      "data/privacy-rules.json",
      "data/tracker-lists.json",
      "data/blocking-rules.json"
    ],
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
  }
]
```

### How to Apply Fix

1. **Rebuild the extension:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Reload the extension in Chrome:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Privaseer"
   - Click the refresh icon (üîÑ)
   - Or remove and re-add the extension

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Visit any website (e.g., https://www.bbc.co.uk)
   - Open DevTools Console (F12)
   - The error should be gone
   - You should see no console errors from consent-scanner

### What This Does

**Before Fix:**
```
Content Script ‚Üí fetch('data/privacy-rules.json') ‚Üí ‚ùå BLOCKED
```

**After Fix:**
```
Content Script ‚Üí fetch(chrome.runtime.getURL('data/privacy-rules.json')) ‚Üí ‚úÖ ALLOWED
```

The `web_accessible_resources` directive tells Chrome: "Allow content scripts running on any URL to access these JSON files from the extension."

### Security Note

This is safe because:
1. Only JSON data files are exposed (no code)
2. Files are read-only
3. Only accessible by the extension's own content scripts
4. No sensitive data in the files (just tracker patterns)

## Other Common Issues

### Extension Icon Not Showing

**Problem:** Shield icon doesn't appear in toolbar

**Solution:**
1. Check that icon files exist in `dist/icons/`
2. Verify manifest.json has correct icon paths
3. Try reloading the extension

### Badge Not Updating

**Problem:** Badge count stuck or not showing

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on a website (not chrome:// page)
2. Check that protection is enabled (shield is blue)
3. Visit a site with known trackers (e.g., news sites)
4. Badge updates per-tab, switch tabs to see different counts

### Tracker Blocking Not Working

**Problem:** Trackers are not being blocked

**Solution:**
1. Check shield button - is it blue (enabled) or gray (paused)?
2. Click shield to toggle protection
3. Reload the webpage
4. Check DevTools Network tab to see blocked requests

### Popup Not Opening

**Problem:** Clicking extension icon does nothing

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `dist/src/popup/popup.html` exists
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`
4. Reload extension

### Build Failures

**Problem:** `npm run build` fails

**Solution:**
1. Delete `node_modules` and `dist` folders
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Check for TypeScript errors

## Getting Help

If issues persist:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for error messages
2. **Check extension console:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "background.html" under extension
   - Check for errors
3. **Rebuild from scratch:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules dist
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

## Known Limitations

These are NOT bugs, they're expected behavior:

1. **Badge resets on browser restart** - Chrome limitation
2. **No blocking on chrome:// pages** - Chrome security policy
3. **Protection toggle requires page reload for some sites** - Cached resources
4. **Badge doesn't show on empty tabs** - No website to analyze

## FAQ

**Q: Why does the extension need "<all_urls>" permission?**
A: To scan for cookie banners and block trackers on all websites you visit.

**Q: Is my data collected?**
A: No. Everything runs locally. Zero telemetry, zero external requests.

**Q: Can I use this on Firefox?**
A: Not yet. Firefox uses Manifest V2. A port may come in the future.

**Q: Why are some trackers not blocked?**
A: Some trackers are essential for website functionality (e.g., payment processors). We have a "never block" list to prevent breaking sites.

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
A: Check the console for errors and note the steps to reproduce.
