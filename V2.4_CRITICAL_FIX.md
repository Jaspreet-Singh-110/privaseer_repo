# Privaseer v2.4 - Critical Scoring Fix

## 🚨 CRITICAL FLAW IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### The Problem (v2.3 and earlier)

**MAJOR BUG**: Same domain penalized on every page refresh

```typescript
// BROKEN BEHAVIOR (v2.3):
User visits CNN.com → 12 trackers blocked → Score: 100 → 88
User refreshes CNN.com → Same 12 trackers blocked → Score: 88 → 76  ❌
User refreshes again → Same trackers → Score: 76 → 64  ❌
User refreshes again → Same trackers → Score: 64 → 52  ❌

// After 4 refreshes: Score dropped 48 points for ONE website!
```

### Why This is Fundamentally Broken

1. **Not a New Privacy Exposure**: Refreshing doesn't expose user to new trackers
2. **Technical Action ≠ Privacy Decision**: Refresh is a technical action, not a privacy choice
3. **Easily Manipulated**: User could artificially lower/raise score by refreshing
4. **Meaningless Scoring**: Score becomes function of refresh count, not privacy behavior
5. **User Frustration**: Perfect privacy habits but score crashes from normal browsing
6. **Loss of Trust**: Users quickly realize the system is unfair and stop caring

### Real-World Impact

```
Scenario: Normal user reading news

Morning routine:
1. Visit CNN.com → 12 trackers → Score: 100 → 88
2. Read article, refresh for updates → Score: 88 → 76
3. Check comments, refresh → Score: 76 → 64
4. Reload after video freeze → Score: 64 → 52

Result: User penalized 48 points for reading ONE news site ❌

Old scoring message: "Poor Privacy (52/100)"
Reality: User made ONE privacy decision (visiting CNN)
```

## ✅ THE FIX: 24-Hour Cooldown System

### Solution Overview

**Hybrid Approach**: Track domain penalties with 24-hour cooldown

```typescript
// FIXED BEHAVIOR (v2.4):
User visits CNN.com → 12 trackers blocked → Score: 100 → 88 ✅
User refreshes CNN.com → Trackers blocked but NO penalty → Score: 88 ✅
User refreshes 10 more times → Still no penalty → Score: 88 ✅

Next day:
User visits CNN.com → Trackers blocked → Score: 88 → 76 ✅

// Same domain only penalized ONCE per 24 hours!
```

### Implementation Details

**Core Mechanism**:
```typescript
class PrivacyScoreManager {
  // Track penalized domains with timestamps
  private static penalizedDomains = new Map<string, number>();
  private static readonly COOLDOWN_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours

  static async handleTrackerBlocked(domain: string, riskWeight: number): Promise<number> {
    const now = Date.now();
    const lastPenalty = this.penalizedDomains.get(domain);

    // Check if we penalized this domain in last 24 hours
    if (lastPenalty && (now - lastPenalty) < this.COOLDOWN_MS) {
      // Domain in cooldown - skip penalty
      logger.debug('PrivacyScore', `Already penalized ${domain} today, skipping`);
      return await this.getCurrentScore();
    }

    // Apply penalty and remember
    this.penalizedDomains.set(domain, now);

    const data = await Storage.get();
    const penalty = this.TRACKER_PENALTY * riskWeight;
    const newScore = data.privacyScore.current + penalty;
    await Storage.updateScore(newScore);

    return newScore;
  }
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Domain-Based Tracking**: Each tracker domain tracked separately
2. **24-Hour Cooldown**: Same domain can only penalize once per day
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Old entries (>7 days) automatically removed
4. **Memory Efficient**: Periodic cleanup prevents unbounded growth
5. **Persistent Across Sessions**: Map persists in memory during browser session

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### Scenario 1: Normal Browsing with Refreshes

```
Action: Visit CNN.com, refresh 5 times

BEFORE (v2.3):
Visit #1: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 100 → 88
Refresh #1: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 88 → 76  ❌
Refresh #2: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 76 → 64  ❌
Refresh #3: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 64 → 52  ❌
Refresh #4: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 52 → 40  ❌
Refresh #5: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 40 → 28  ❌

Final Score: 28 (Poor - Red) ❌
Total Penalty: -72 points
User Action: Visited ONE website
System Behavior: UNFAIR - penalized for technical actions

AFTER (v2.4):
Visit #1: 12 trackers → -12 points → Score: 100 → 88 ✅
Refresh #1: 12 trackers → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅ (cooldown active)
Refresh #2: 12 trackers → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅ (cooldown active)
Refresh #3: 12 trackers → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅ (cooldown active)
Refresh #4: 12 trackers → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅ (cooldown active)
Refresh #5: 12 trackers → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅ (cooldown active)

Final Score: 88 (Excellent - Green) ✅
Total Penalty: -12 points
User Action: Visited ONE website
System Behavior: FAIR - penalized once for one decision
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Day Browsing

```
Day 1:
- Morning: Visit CNN.com → -12 points → Score: 100 → 88
- Afternoon: Refresh CNN 3 times → 0 points → Score: 88 ✅
- Evening: Visit different site → -5 points → Score: 83

Day 2:
- Morning: Visit CNN.com again → -12 points → Score: 71 ✅
  (24 hours passed, cooldown expired)
- Refresh CNN → 0 points → Score: 71 ✅

Day 3:
- Visit CNN → -12 points → Score: 59 ✅
  (Another 24 hours passed)

Result: Each day, CNN penalized ONCE regardless of refreshes ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Tracker Domains

```
Visit CNN.com with multiple trackers:
- google-analytics.com → -1 point (first time) ✅
- doubleclick.net → -2 points (first time) ✅
- facebook.com → -2 points (first time) ✅

Refresh CNN.com:
- google-analytics.com → 0 points (cooldown) ✅
- doubleclick.net → 0 points (cooldown) ✅
- facebook.com → 0 points (cooldown) ✅

Visit different site with same trackers:
- google-analytics.com → 0 points (cooldown) ✅
- doubleclick.net → 0 points (cooldown) ✅

Next day, visit CNN.com:
- google-analytics.com → -1 point (cooldown expired) ✅
- doubleclick.net → -2 points (cooldown expired) ✅
- facebook.com → -2 points (cooldown expired) ✅

Result: Each tracker domain penalized once per 24 hours ✅
```

## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why 24-Hour Cooldown?

| Duration | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Per-Session** | No refresh penalty | Can game by reopening browser |
| **30 Minutes** | Short cooldown | Same site multiple times/day penalized |
| **1 Hour** | Moderate | Still catches normal re-visits |
| **24 Hours** ✅ | Fair for daily habits | Long cooldown |
| **Weekly** | Very forgiving | Not enough granularity |

**Chosen: 24 Hours** because:
- ✅ **Fair**: One privacy decision per day per domain
- ✅ **Realistic**: Daily visits = distinct privacy choices
- ✅ **Simple**: Easy to understand ("once per day")
- ✅ **Effective**: Prevents refresh abuse completely
- ✅ **Balanced**: Catches repeated visits while preventing gaming

### Why Track by Tracker Domain?

```
Option A: Track by visited site (e.g., cnn.com)
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: Multiple trackers on same site = multiple penalties on refresh

Option B: Track by tracker domain (e.g., google-analytics.com) ✅
- Pros: Each tracker penalized once per day regardless of which site
- Cons: Slightly more complex
- Chosen: More accurate privacy representation
```

**Example**:
```
Visit CNN.com → google-analytics.com blocked → -1 point
Visit BBC.com → google-analytics.com blocked → 0 points (cooldown)
Visit NYT.com → google-analytics.com blocked → 0 points (cooldown)

Result: Google Analytics penalized ONCE per day regardless of how many sites use it ✅
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```typescript
// In-memory tracking (persists during browser session)
private static penalizedDomains = new Map<string, number>();
// Key: tracker domain (e.g., "google-analytics.com")
// Value: timestamp of last penalty (e.g., 1696435200000)

Example state:
{
  "google-analytics.com": 1696435200000,
  "doubleclick.net": 1696435201000,
  "facebook.com": 1696435202000,
  "fingerprintjs.com": 1696435203000
}
```

### Cooldown Check Logic

```typescript
static async handleTrackerBlocked(domain: string, riskWeight: number): Promise<number> {
  const now = Date.now(); // Current timestamp
  const lastPenalty = this.penalizedDomains.get(domain); // When we last penalized this domain

  // If we penalized this domain before
  if (lastPenalty) {
    const timeSincePenalty = now - lastPenalty; // How long ago
    const cooldownRemaining = this.COOLDOWN_MS - timeSincePenalty; // Time left

    // If less than 24 hours passed
    if (cooldownRemaining > 0) {
      // Skip penalty
      logger.debug('PrivacyScore', `${domain} in cooldown for ${cooldownRemaining}ms`);
      return await this.getCurrentScore(); // Return unchanged score
    }
  }

  // Cooldown expired or first time - apply penalty
  this.penalizedDomains.set(domain, now); // Remember this penalty

  const penalty = this.TRACKER_PENALTY * riskWeight;
  const newScore = currentScore + penalty;
  await Storage.updateScore(newScore);

  return newScore;
}
```

### Cleanup Mechanism

```typescript
private static cleanupOldPenalties(): void {
  const cutoff = Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 7 days ago
  let cleaned = 0;

  for (const [domain, timestamp] of this.penalizedDomains.entries()) {
    if (timestamp < cutoff) {
      this.penalizedDomains.delete(domain); // Remove old entries
      cleaned++;
    }
  }

  if (cleaned > 0) {
    logger.debug('PrivacyScore', `Cleaned up ${cleaned} old penalty entries`);
  }
}

// Called every 100 penalties to prevent unbounded growth
if (this.penalizedDomains.size % 100 === 0) {
  this.cleanupOldPenalties();
}
```

### Memory Management

**Worst Case Scenario**:
```
User visits 1,000 unique tracker domains per day
After 7 days: 7,000 entries maximum
Memory usage: ~700KB (100 bytes per entry)

Result: Negligible memory impact ✅
```

**Typical Scenario**:
```
User visits 50 unique tracker domains per day
After 7 days: 350 entries
Cleanup removes entries older than 7 days
Steady state: 200-400 entries
Memory usage: ~20-40KB

Result: Extremely minimal memory impact ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Test Case 1: Basic Cooldown

```typescript
// Test: Same domain blocked multiple times within 24 hours
test('Same domain blocked multiple times - only penalized once', async () => {
  const initialScore = 100;

  // First block - should penalize
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(99); // -1 point

  // Second block (1 minute later) - should NOT penalize
  await sleep(60000); // 1 minute
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(99); // No change

  // Third block (1 hour later) - should NOT penalize
  await sleep(3600000); // 1 hour
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(99); // No change

  // Fourth block (24 hours later) - SHOULD penalize
  await sleep(24 * 3600000); // 24 hours
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(98); // -1 point
});
```

### Test Case 2: Multiple Domains

```typescript
// Test: Different domains have independent cooldowns
test('Different domains have independent cooldowns', async () => {
  const initialScore = 100;

  // Block analytics - penalized
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(99);

  // Block doubleclick - penalized
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('doubleclick.net', 2);
  expect(score).toBe(97);

  // Block analytics again - NOT penalized (cooldown)
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('google-analytics.com', 1);
  expect(score).toBe(97);

  // Block doubleclick again - NOT penalized (cooldown)
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('doubleclick.net', 2);
  expect(score).toBe(97);
});
```

### Test Case 3: Cleanup

```typescript
// Test: Old entries are cleaned up
test('Old entries cleaned up after 7 days', async () => {
  // Add 100 domains
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked(`tracker${i}.com`, 1);
  }

  expect(PrivacyScoreManager.getPenalizedDomainCount()).toBe(100);

  // Advance time 8 days
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(8 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

  // Add one more to trigger cleanup
  await PrivacyScoreManager.handleTrackerBlocked('new-tracker.com', 1);

  // All old entries should be gone
  expect(PrivacyScoreManager.getPenalizedDomainCount()).toBeLessThan(10);
});
```

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### User Experience

**Before (v2.3)**:
- ❌ Users complained about rapid score drops
- ❌ Refreshing pages = score plummeting
- ❌ Normal browsing = poor scores
- ❌ Loss of trust in scoring system
- ❌ Users stopped caring about privacy score

**After (v2.4)**:
- ✅ Fair scoring reflects actual privacy decisions
- ✅ Refreshing pages doesn't affect score
- ✅ Normal browsing = accurate scores
- ✅ Trust in scoring system maintained
- ✅ Users engage with privacy score

### Score Accuracy

**Before**: Score = f(privacy decisions × refresh count) ❌
**After**: Score = f(privacy decisions) ✅

### Example User Journey

```
Week 1 (v2.3 - BROKEN):
Monday: Visit 5 news sites, refresh often → Score: 40 (Poor)
User reaction: "This is broken, I barely browsed today!"

Week 1 (v2.4 - FIXED):
Monday: Visit 5 news sites, refresh often → Score: 75 (Good)
User reaction: "Accurate! I visited tracker-heavy news sites."
```
